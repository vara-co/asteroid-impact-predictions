Note: It is important that if you are going to use this code, all files
are placed in a directory that matches this repository, for the better functionality of it.
Otherwise you would have to adjust the paths on the files, accordingly.

This repository consists of a team project where we explore the predictability of asteroid impacts using machine learning models.

Guide to the Project
----------------------------------

### Guidelines for the Project
1.  Collaborating with our team to pool knowledge and share ideas
2.  Outline a scope and purpose for our project, utilzing our machine learning skills to analyze,solve, or visualize our findings
3.  Finding reliable data to use for our project, being mindful of copyrights, licenses, or terms of use
4.  Track all processes in Jupyter Notebook used for cleanup, and techniques used for Data Analysis
5.  Present our findings to the class on Presentation Day, with each member of our group taking turns in speaking
6.  Submit the URL of our GitHub repository to be graded
7.  Graduate and attain employment from utilizing our knowlwdge acquired from this class
   
### Processes used 
1.  Reading the csv files
2.  Cleaning the data
3.  Normalize and stabalize the data
4.  Splitting the data
5.  Training the Machine Learning models
6.  Neural Network model implementation
7.  Created a different Jupyter notebook with the same cleanup process to test Supervised Learning model
8.  Supervised Learning model implementation
9.  Confusion Matrix and Visualization
10. Compared observations and searched for improved accuracy for each model.

## Accuracy for the Neural Network Model (Pre-optimization and Optimized results)
![NN_model_AccuracyComparison](https://github.com/maparisio/Asteroid-Impact-Prediction/assets/152572519/7282e365-dd18-4676-8bd1-9dc1c155a53b)

## Accuracy for the Supervised Learning Model

1. Low precision and recall due to imbalance of data classes
